# ccstar - CCTray proxy for AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline

A project to allow [CCTray](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ccnet/files/CruiseControl.NET%20Releases/CruiseControl.NET%201.8.5/), [CCMenu](http://ccmenu.org/), [Nevergreen](https://github.com/build-canaries/nevergreen), and other
 compatible clients to read the status of projects in AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline via the [CCTray common format](https://cctray.org/v1/).
 
More documentation to come soon. Probably. Unless Mike gets distracted.
